#LSInput - [Website](http://limestudios.net/article/lsinput)
I made LSInput to address the issues I had with Unity's input manager setup.

##Setup
- Add the needed Axes to the InputManager in Unity. [Example](http://limestudios.net/article/lsinput/#setup)
- Initialize a new LSInput in the script you want to use it in.
- In your script's Update method put the updates for the desired parts of LSInput.
- That's it you're done!
